    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",

    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",

We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "1. Gradient Boosting Classifier:\n",
    "**Real-world application: Higgs Boson Discovery. The large hadron collider dataset, Ranking websites and Ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Strengths: Robustness to outliers, Trees are build sequentially, which can improve over the previous trees,\n",
    "Prone to over-fitting unless tree depth and learning rate are controlled correctly, Fast training without sacrificing accuracy,\n",
    "can handle different types of predictor variables (numerical, categorical) (heterogeneous features).\n",

    "**The weaknesses:\tscalability, since is sequential it can hardly be parallelized, slow in some cases, Cannot compute Conditional class probabilities, Long sequential computation times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condidate: gradient boosting algorithm is to repetitively leverage the patterns in residuals and strengthen a model with weak predictions and make it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Classifier: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world application: Video classification for YouTube (decide which video is appropriate or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Strengths: Efficiently in large data sets, Applicable to both regression and classification problems & Is not parametric, therefore no formal distribution assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The weaknesses: Difficult to interpret, Slow to evaluation & If the data includes groups of correlated features of equal relevance for the output variable, then small groups are favored over large groups\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condidate: Stability, if you change the data a little, the individual trees may change, but the forest is relatively stable, because is the combination of many trees & Maintains accuracy when a large proportion of data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):\n",
    "**Real-world application: Text classification, Image recognition, Handwritten digit identification, Protein identification, Image recognition & Writing / digit recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Strengths: Works well in complex domains where there is not a clear margin of separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The weaknesses: Don’t perform well in larger data sets, because the training time happens to be cubic to the size of the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Condidate: erforms like Logistic Regression when no linear separation. The main reason to use SVM instead LR is because your problem might not be linearly separable. Use a SVM with a nonlinear Kernel example (RBF).\n",

For instance, this simple Decision Tree determining on how to finding donors for an individual that make more than $50,000. In our census data, The tree takes several features (e.g. age, education, capital gain and sex ...etc) into account, and given each feature either makes a decision or asks another question. for example we could asking about the education (if he hold a bachelor/ Phd degree) if high degree then ask about the age ( older with high experiance) these sequance will help to predict the individual with high income would be high propability to be a donor.[1]\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
