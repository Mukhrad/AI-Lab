# Dog Breed Classifier-DSND Capstone



## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline that  can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world,  user-supplied images.  Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will  identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.  If supplied an image of a  human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification  and localization, you will make important design decisions about the  user experience for your app.  Our goal is that by completing this lab,  you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of  models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline.   Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a  real-world application often involves solving many problems without a  perfect answer.  Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun  user experience!

## Project Motivation

This technique could be applying on the DNA processing as well in the simple way you could recognise the parents from the images of their kids as well predicting some features that related to others in case of early detection diseases. There are many application related to ours that highly motivating nowadays.

## Detection Techniques 

A.	We use for face detection OpenCV's implementation of Haar feature-based cascade classifiers to detect human faces in images.
B.	We use  for dogs detection the VGG-16 model (Pre-train model) , along with weights that have been trained on ImageNet.

## Model Design

A.CNN from scratch (Model Scratch)

B.Transfer Learning Model

## DATA Analysis
As showcased in the jupyter notebook, I have below analysis results of the input dataset:

* There are 133 total dog categories.
* There are 8351 total dog images.
* There are 6680 training dog images.
* There are 835 validation dog images.
* There are 836 test dog images.
* There are 13233 total human images.

## Performance Metrics 

To measure performance of our model we used the following metric:

* Classification Accuracy
Classification Accuracy is what we usually mean, when we use the term accuracy. It is the ratio of number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.

## Project Results:
In summary, the performance of the pre-trained model I built far exceeded the hand made CNN model. The accuracy of the model reached 80% while my CNN was about 13%.  This improved performance can be attributed to the vast dataset on which the pre-trained model was built.  In particular, the pre-trained model was also exposed to many dog images, making it particularly ready to classify dog breeds.

## Conclusion and Discussion:
In this project, we learned how are the importance of the transfer learning compared to our scratch model that reach accuracy performance 13%. We're facing many problem that regarding to building CNN model from scratch that confuse us on how many conv layer should I built, what are the best filters and the features depth , all these optimization as well manipulating the hyperparameter takes long time of processing, further the face detection based haarcascade because it shows some dogs' faces have the features of human face. In transfer learning, it's not easy way to deal with the processing it takes many time trying to optimaizing the best parameter that gives us high accuracy performance as well the proficiency of our GPU.
